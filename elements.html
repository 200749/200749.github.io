										<h3 class="major">What are some interesting different types of instruments that I could build? </h3>
										<p> Kalimba </p>
<p>If I made a kalimba what are some advantages, and disadvantages? </p>
<ul>
<li> Advantage- It would be completely homemade, and I would be able to find the materials easily around my house </li>
<li> Disadvantage- It would be too easy to build, and too easy to find materials. It also seems like the instructions are very vague, and not very well instructed. </li> 
<li>I could build it using materials like tin cans, and cutting a hole in the middle, and possibly bending wire (or metal) in order to create the different parts for the finger piano) </li>
</ul>

<p> Ukelule </p>
<p>If I made a ukelele what are some advantages, and disadvantages?  </p>
<ul>
<li> Advantage- It would be challenging to make the sides of the ukelele, and it wouldn’t be totally difficult. </li>
<li> Disadvantage- It would be the same as everyone else, and wouldn’t look professional. i also wouldn’t know where to source the materials, in order to build the ukelele. </li>
<p>  Where would I get the strings?</p> <li> I could source them, but i would still need to pay for them. </li>
<p>Where would I get the wood? </p>
<li>Some of the supermarkets give the wood, as they only need it to transport the goods, and don’t need it after.</li>

<p>"Having an experienced guitar builder such as Pat to turn to for advice gave me the courage to build one. But once I got started, I experimented with how I could build it without the specialized equipment that many guitar builders use. I will also be covering Pat Hawley's more professional build of a ukulele alongside my experiments. I also have Free ukulele plans available " </p>


<p> Theremin </p>
<p>If I made a Theremin what are some advantages, and disadvantages?  </p>
<ul>
<li> Advantages- It would be challenging, and the end result I would have learned a lot, and have found out more about how circuits produce waves. It would be a different instrument than everyone else. </li>
<li> 
Disadvantage- I might not find the materials, it might not be tunable, and it might be too difficult. </li>
<p>Where would I get the materials?  </p>
<li>I could get the materials from Sham Shui Po, for a pretty cheap price, and if I could build it quite quickly, I can focus on tuning the instrument.

<p>"A full-fledged Theremin will set you back nearly $400, but with the instructions below, you can build a pocket-sized Theremin-like instrument that won't break the bank. Unlike the real McCoy which relies on grounded variable capacitance for changing frequency and volume with the wave of a hand, our Pocket Theremin uses variations in light for producing its unearthly vibrato.

										<h3 class="major">What instrument would truly reflect the waves that an instrument should have? 
 </h3>
<p> Instruments generating music- can happen in many different ways. An instrument creates music/sound by causing something to vibrate. For a wind instrument that might be the column of air. For the string instrument, it would be the strings, and for the drum, it it the stretched skin. 

However, for electrical music instruments, this would be reflected in a different manner. Unlike acoustic instruments, these electrical music do not make actual sounds as a acoustic instrument would. Most electric instruments produce an electrical signal, in which would be transmitted to an amplifier, and broadcasted using a loudspeaker. They can make sounds like acoustic instruments through a process called synthesis. </p>

<p>"Acoustic instruments generate sound physically and electronic instruments create sound electrically. There are four acoustic groups: percussion (hit or shaken), wind (woodwind and brass; blown), string (bowed or plucked), and keyboard (played with fingers)." </p>

										<h3 class="major">What parts would I need to find in my home for the project?
 </h3>
<p> 
Just NOTES. I am thinking of most likely making a theremin. To do so, I will be needing the parts, and will need to source them, as I don’t have some of the materials at home. Some of the materials I already have include wire, and a breadboard to test it out. Everything else, I need to source from either in HK, or online. If I don’t find something in those two places, then I might need to research an alternative idea.

										<h3 class="major">How would I tune the instrument? </h3>

<p> The sound changes through the different light. If the light is really strong then the theremin will produce a sound wave with a high frequency. The amplitude would be adjusted by the potentiometer. I am guessing if I can possibly control the lights, then I could tune my instrument. </p>

<p>"Unlike a conventional Theremin which operates on two radio frequency oscillators, this Pocket Theremin consists of an oscillator and frequency divider that are manipulated by changes in light. Be forewarned, the Pocket Theremin is very light sensitive and must be "played" in subdued lighting for achieving the best sound effects." </p>

										<h3 class="major">Where would I get my materials? 
 </h3>

<p> 
The shop might be handy, as I have checked out their online store, and they seem to be a hobby store for engineers. They seem to have small individual parts that are necessary to create my theremin. I also know that Sham Shui Po has a lot of electronic stores in the area, and in close proximity of this one. Therefore, I am probably going to go to the store this weekend in order to start to source for some materials.

										<h3 class="major">How are waves affecting my instruments? 
 
 </h3>

 <ul>
<l> 
Music can be produced in many ways. Since different instruments use different methods to produces sound waves, they have classified the instruments into 5 main groups (originally 4, but later adding the 5th due to having electronic musical instruments) </l>

<p>Here are the groups: </p>
<l>Idiophones- this is where the entire instrument will vibrate, in which include xylophones, cymbals, maracas.</l>

<l>Membranophones- these produce sound by vibrating the membranes, these can include kazoos, and drums. </l>

<l>Chordophones- where the vibrating strings cause the sound waves. These include violins, and guitars or any stringed instrument. (standing wave) </l>

<l>Aerophones- (standing waves in pipes)  when the air is vibrating to create the wave. (any flute, reed, or long tubed instrument) </l>

<l>Electro-phones- Produce vibrations by electronic means. </l>
</ul>

<p>"The Sachs-Hornbostel system classified instrument in four main groups (later adding a fifth with the introduction of electronic instruments such as the theremin).
•Idiophones – where the entire instrument vibrates (such as a xylophone bar, maracas, cymbals, etc.)
•Membranophones – which produce sound by vibrating membranes (drums, kazoos)
•Chordophones – vibrating strings
•Aerophones – where air vibrates - horns, flutes, reeds, and some others
•Electrophones – vibrations produced by electronic means

<p> How do theremin’s produce waves? </p>
<p> 
Theremin’s produce waves through having an electrical circuit in which is connected to a speaker. The speaker amplifies the wave to create music. An electric instrument produces an electrical circuit, in which is amplified by the speaker. This does not work in the same way as a normal instrument, as it does not run on the vibrations of the instrument itself, but on the electrical circuit. </p>
 <p>How does an electrical circuit make waves? How are waves produced? </p>
 <p>
The electrical circuit itself does not produce any sound but produces a current of energy, and that is amplified by the speaker. </p>

<p> Are they digital or analog signals?
</p>
<p>
Analog signal, because we have an oscillator and don’t have a digital circuit. We don’t have a digital circuit to create a digital waves. 
</p>
<p>WHat changes the signal’s amplitude? </p>
<p> 
The potentiometer which is connected to the circuit helps control the signal, as it is attached directly to the speaker. By adjusting the potentiometer (in which adjusts the volume of the speaker) will adjust the signal’s amplitude. The more energy inputted, or allowed into the speaker, the more volume is outputted. 
</p>
<p>What is pitch? 
</p>
<p> 
The pitch changes with the frequency of the wave. The more frequent the wave, the higher the pitch. Since my theremin is light-sensitive, and is a photo theremin
</p>
<p>How does the behavior of waves affect my theremin? 
</p> 
<p> 
Firstly, it affects the instrument in many different ways. The first it that the instrument is light sensitive in which I have made the light more intense by adding a reflective surface to my design. By doing this, it allows me to further enhance the light coming from the LED. The second is that the waves coming out from the speaker are not only reflecting off of certain surfaces, but are also being refracted, transmitted and absorbed (as well as possibly resonating) whilst it interacts with other materials around. 
</p>
<p>What are the different types of theremins around? 
</p>
<p>I made the photo theremin ( in which it is sensitive to light, and produces sound based on this) 
However, there are normal theremins (where is is inductor theremin, where it is sensitive to induction, antennas)
