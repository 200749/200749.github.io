										<h3 class="major">What are some interesting different types of instruments that I could build? </h3>
										<p> Kalimba </p>
<p>If I made a kalimba what are some advantages, and disadvantages? </p>
<ul>
<li> Advantage- It would be completely homemade, and I would be able to find the materials easily around my house </li>
<li> Disadvantage- It would be too easy to build, and too easy to find materials. It also seems like the instructions are very vague, and not very well instructed. </li> 
<li>I could build it using materials like tin cans, and cutting a hole in the middle, and possibly bending wire (or metal) in order to create the different parts for the finger piano) </li>
</ul>

<p>"First someone in family drunk tea. There I got tin can. Then I cut aluminum rods and one bigger rod.I drilled holes on can, rods and bolted rods on can." </p>





<p> Ukelule </p>
<p>If I made a ukelele what are some advantages, and disadvantages?  </p>
<ul>
<li> Advantage- It would be challenging to make the sides of the ukelele, and it wouldn’t be totally difficult. </li>
<li> Disadvantage- It would be the same as everyone else, and wouldn’t look professional. i also wouldn’t know where to source the materials, in order to build the ukelele. </li>
<p>  Where would I get the strings?</p> <li> I could source them, but i would still need to pay for them. </li>
<p>Where would I get the wood? </p>
<li>Some of the supermarkets give the wood, as they only need it to transport the goods, and don’t need it after.</li>

</ul>

<p>"Having an experienced guitar builder such as Pat to turn to for advice gave me the courage to build one. But once I got started, I experimented with how I could build it without the specialized equipment that many guitar builders use. I will also be covering Pat Hawley's more professional build of a ukulele alongside my experiments. I also have Free ukulele plans available " </p>
