												<h4>Reflection Questions </h4>
												<ul>
													<li>What type of wave does your instrument use?

												
</li>

<p> 
Types of waves used: 
What are waves? 
Waves are a disturbance that travels through the medium, and moves energy from one place to another.
What are the different types of waves? 
There are many different types of waves, that are separated into two different categories. There are electromagnetic waves, which can travel in mediums, and in vacuums. There is also mechanical waves, which can only travel through mediums. 
The waves also take different forms. There are compressional waves, in which travel as compressions and rarefactions, and there are longitudinal waves, in which travel as crests and troughs. A compressional wave occurs when the energy being transferred from one place to another, is in parallel to the direction the wave is travelling. A transverse wave occurs when the energy is travelling perpendicular to the way the wave is travelling, creating crests and troughs. 

What are crests, and troughs? 
Crests are the highest point from the equilibrium (resting point) as the wave goes.
Troughs are the lowest point from the equilibrium(resting point) as the wave goes. 

What are compressions and rarefactions? 
Compressions are when the wave momentarily pushes the particles closer together, leaving space, called rarefactions (places with less particles)  

Which types of waves does my own instrument use? 

The theremin uses all of the different types of waves. Sound waves are both a compressional, and mechanical wave. This means that it travels as a compressional wave, but can only travel through a medium. The theremin produces sound waves through the speaker (in which amplifies the sound). However since my theremin is also light sensitive, I have installed a LED light circuitry, in which the LED light and theremin circuitry is in the box, and the switches and potentiometer (as well as the speaker) are all outside the box, allowing me to control the light, which controls the frequency of the sound. Light is a transverse wave, as well as a electromagnetic wave (it travels through vacuums and mediums) 

Are the waves analog or digital waves? 

The waves are carrying energy from one place to another, and the waves produced are actually analog for my theremin. 

Analog circuitry usually has capacitors, resistors. I can also change the amplitude, and frequency, which means that it isn’t a digital signal, but analog signal. </p>

													<li>How did you identify the amplitudes and frequencies that are produced from your instrument? 
 
</li>

<p> What is amplitude? 
Amplitude is the highest point away from the equilibrium a wave is. The amplitude in sound waves depicts how loud the sound produced is. For a light wave, the amplitude shows the different intensities of light. I identified the amplitude in many ways. Not only is it depicted as a sound wave (through the speaker) but also through the light controls that I have implemented to help me control the sound. The amplitude of the sound wave in my instrument could be controlled by a potentiometer ( which controls the energy input to the oscillator/amplifier, in which amplitude and energy have a direct relationship) and the light intensity which is controlled also by a potentiometer. THe amplitude of the light wave impacts the frequency of the sound coming out of the speaker. 
Another way the amplitude can be measured is through using a oscillator. By using this, I could put it near my speaker, and see how loud the sound was when produced. I found a website which was helpful in doing so. 

What is frequency? 
Frequency is how frequent the wave does one cycle in an amount of time. For sound waves the frequency changes the pitch of the sound. The more frequent the waves, the more high pitched the sound. 
													<li>How have the characteristics of the wave (e.g., frequency, amplitude, wavelength) changed after it has interacted with a material ?
</li>

													<li>Where does the sound originate? Describe how the sound of your instrument is made.
</li>

													<li>How are sound waves transmitted, absorbed or reflected within your instrument or by other interacting materials?
 </li>

													<li>Using a brainframe compare and contrast the differences between how matter waves interact with different materials. This can be your own musical instrument interacting with different materials or comparing your instrument with another student’s instrument.
</li>
<li>Use your instrument to describe why materials with certain properties are well-suited for particular functions.

 </li>

 <h3> Transfer Questions </h3> 
 <p> Was your musical instrument successful? Why or why not? </p>

 <p> What improvements would you make to your musical instrument  if you built it again? </p>
