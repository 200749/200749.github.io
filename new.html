									<h3 class="major">What type of wave does your instrument use? </h3>
									<p>
Types of waves used: 
What are waves? 
Waves are a disturbance that travels through the medium, and moves energy from one place to another.
What are the different types of waves? 
There are many different types of waves, that are separated into two different categories. There are electromagnetic waves, which can travel in mediums, and in vacuums. There is also mechanical waves, which can only travel through mediums. 
The waves also take different forms. There are compressional waves, in which travel as compressions and rarefactions, and there are longitudinal waves, in which travel as crests and troughs. A compressional wave occurs when the energy being transferred from one place to another, is in parallel to the direction the wave is travelling. A transverse wave occurs when the energy is travelling perpendicular to the way the wave is travelling, creating crests and troughs. 

What are crests, and troughs? 
Crests are the highest point from the equilibrium (resting point) as the wave goes.
Troughs are the lowest point from the equilibrium(resting point) as the wave goes. 

What are compressions and rarefactions? 
Compressions are when the wave momentarily pushes the particles closer together, leaving space, called rarefactions (places with less particles)  

Which types of waves does my own instrument use? 

The theremin uses all of the different types of waves. Sound waves are both a compressional, and mechanical wave. This means that it travels as a compressional wave, but can only travel through a medium. The theremin produces sound waves through the speaker (in which amplifies the sound). However since my theremin is also light sensitive, I have installed a LED light circuitry, in which the LED light and theremin circuitry is in the box, and the switches and potentiometer (as well as the speaker) are all outside the box, allowing me to control the light, which controls the frequency of the sound. Light is a transverse wave, as well as a electromagnetic wave (it travels through vacuums and mediums) 

Are the waves analog or digital waves? 

The waves are carrying energy from one place to another, and the waves produced are actually analog for my theremin. 

Analog circuitry usually has capacitors, resistors. I can also change the amplitude, and frequency, which means that it isn’t a digital signal, but analog signal. 
</p>

						

									<h3 class="major">How did you identify the amplitudes and frequencies that are produced from your instrument? 
</h3>
									<p>Amplitude is the highest point away from the equilibrium a wave is. The amplitude in sound waves depicts how loud the sound produced is. For a light wave, the amplitude shows the different intensities of light. I identified the amplitude in many ways. Not only is it depicted as a sound wave (through the speaker) but also through the light controls that I have implemented to help me control the sound. The amplitude of the sound wave in my instrument could be controlled by a potentiometer ( which controls the energy input to the oscillator/amplifier, in which amplitude and energy have a direct relationship) and the light intensity which is controlled also by a potentiometer. THe amplitude of the light wave impacts the frequency of the sound coming out of the speaker. 
Another way the amplitude can be measured is through using a oscillator. By using this, I could put it near my speaker, and see how loud the sound was when produced. I found a website which was helpful in doing so.
What is frequency? 
Frequency is how frequent the wave does one cycle in an amount of time. For sound waves the frequency changes the pitch of the sound. The more frequent the waves, the more high pitched the sound. Light waves are also affected through frequency, as when the frequency increases the light color turns more towards the “cooler” tones, and if the frequency is lower, then it produces more warm tones of color. </p>

<h3 class="major">How have the characteristics of the wave (e.g., frequency, amplitude, wavelength) changed after it has interacted with a material ?

									<h3 class="major">Where does the sound originate? Describe how the sound of your instrument is made.
</h3>
									<p>
The theremin is different from most instruments as it runs on an electrical circuit, in which is amplified by the speaker. Basically an electrical circuit itself does not create a sound, but creates an electrical signal. This electrical signal is then passed through an amplifier (in which is the 555 IC timer for my theremin) and goes through and is broadcasted by a broad speaker. 
</p>




									<h3 class="major">How are sound waves transmitted, absorbed or reflected within your instrument or by other interacting materials?
</h3>
									<p>What is transmission? 
Transmission is when a wave travels through a material, and continues through to the next medium. 


What is absorption? 
Absorption is when a waves energy is passed onto the medium it passes through. 
For waves, absorption occurs when the material resonates at the same frequency as some of the waves. When it resonates it creates vibrations, in which the vibrations will create heat energy. This wave energy is thus created into heat energy as it passes through the medium. 

What is reflection? 
Reflection occurs when the incidence wave bounces off of a surface. Reflection can either be specular or scattered. Specular reflection is with smooth surfaces, in which all of the reflected rays produce the same angle, this occurs with mirrors. For scattered reflection, the waves hitting the surface reflect the surface in different angles but still follow the law of reflection. 

How do these affect my instrument? 
For the sound waves occurring: As the sound wave travels through the medium, it changes, and is being transmitted, through other mediums, absorbed by the walls, and other sound absorbing materials, as well as being reflected off of materials it can’t travel through. 

For light waves: 
The LED light waves experience mostly reflection off of the aluminium foil that I have placed inside the box. However, I did not place the aluminium foil everywhere in the box, and therefore absorption into the cardboard still occurs. 

Are there other factors effecting my instrument? </p>
									



									<h3 class="major">Using a brainframe compare and contrast the differences between how matter waves interact with different materials. This can be your own musical instrument interacting with different materials or comparing your instrument with another student’s instrument.

										<h3 class="major">555 IC Timer </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the 555 IC timer do? 
<p> 
It is the oscillator for the theremin.
The 555 timer can be used in a variety of different ways such as timer, pulse generation, and in this case I used it as an oscillator. An oscillator is used for generating electric currents, and voltage, by non-mechanical means.

										<h3 class="major">CDs Photocells </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the CDs Photocell do? 
<p> 
Photocells are sensors for light, and allow you to detect light. As they are exposed to more light, the resistance goes down. 
When the light intensity changes, it changes the oscillators frequency, producing a higher or lower sound. </p>

										<h3 class="major">5k potentiometer </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the 5k potentiometer do? 
<p> 
For my theremin it helps: 
<ul> 
<l>The potentiometer changes the amplitude of the speaker. </l>

<l>Also, it helps change the amplitude of the light.</l>

The potentiometer helps adjust the voltage power of the light or sound coming through the source. Since the amplitude and energy have a ratio relationship, the more voltage, the more amplitude. 
<ul>

										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>
I didn’t manage to find this piece, and found that it was unneeded so I simply stuck to using the breadboard, and soldering. 
 </p>
<p> What does the split level shielded box do? 
<p> 
I did not use this piece, but it works the same as a PCB terminal board, but it helps put all of the circuitry into a small contained space. </p>

										<h3 class="major">Change-Larger speaker</h3>
										<p> Why did I change the speaker?  </p>
<p>
I changed to a larger speaker, so that there would be more vibrations. This helped produce a larger sound, and also helped with the cymatic production of the instrument.

										<h3 class="major">Change-LED light schematic </h3>
										<p> What was this design?   </p>
<p>
In this design I managed to add more control to my theremin by adding a row of LED lights. By doing this I could have LED lights next to the photocells (which control allow the light to control the frequency produced) I then put the switches for these LED lights outside of the box so that I could control the LED lights, and control the sound produced. 
I also changed the design by adding the light that I could control, which involved more schematics, and LED lightbulbs. I also changed the design so that it was in the box instead, so that I could control almost all the light going to the theremin. 

</p>

									<section>
										<h3 class="major">Change-Aluminium foil</h3>
										<p> Why did I add aluminium foil? </p>
<p>

I added aluminium foil to help produce more reflection (in which it is not specular reflection but scattered) and this helped the light produce more intensity, because it was reflecting off the surface, instead of being absorbed.
