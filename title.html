										<h3 class="major">555 IC Timer </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the 555 IC timer do? 
<p> 
It is the oscillator for the theremin.
The 555 timer can be used in a variety of different ways such as timer, pulse generation, and in this case I used it as an oscillator. An oscillator is used for generating electric currents, and voltage, by non-mechanical means.

										<h3 class="major">CDs Photocells </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the CDs Photocell do? 
<p> 
Photocells are sensors for light, and allow you to detect light. As they are exposed to more light, the resistance goes down. 
When the light intensity changes, it changes the oscillators frequency, producing a higher or lower sound. </p>

										<h3 class="major">0.1 mF capacitators  </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the 0.1 mF capacitator do? 
<p> 

It is used to temporarily  store energy, in an electrical field.

										<h3 class="major">1k resistor </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the 1k resistor do? 
<p> 

Resistors determine the flow of the electrical current.

										<h3 class="major">5k potentiometer </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the 5k potentiometer do? 
<p> 
For my theremin it helps: 
<ul> 
<l>The potentiometer changes the amplitude of the speaker. </l>

<l>Also, it helps change the amplitude of the light.</l>

The potentiometer helps adjust the voltage power of the light or sound coming through the source. Since the amplitude and energy have a ratio relationship, the more voltage, the more amplitude. 
<ul>
