										<h3 class="major">555 IC Timer </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the 555 IC timer do? 
<p> 
It is the oscillator for the theremin.
The 555 timer can be used in a variety of different ways such as timer, pulse generation, and in this case I used it as an oscillator. An oscillator is used for generating electric currents, and voltage, by non-mechanical means.

										<h3 class="major">CDs Photocells </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the CDs Photocell do? 
<p> 
Photocells are sensors for light, and allow you to detect light. As they are exposed to more light, the resistance goes down. 
When the light intensity changes, it changes the oscillators frequency, producing a higher or lower sound. </p>

										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the 0.1 mF capacitator do? 
<p> 

It is used to temporarily  store energy, in an electrical field.

										<h3 class="major">1k resistor </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the 1k resistor do? 
<p> 

Resistors determine the flow of the electrical current.

										<h3 class="major">5k potentiometer </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the 5k potentiometer do? 
<p> 
For my theremin it helps: 
<ul> 
<l>The potentiometer changes the amplitude of the speaker. </l>

<l>Also, it helps change the amplitude of the light.</l>

The potentiometer helps adjust the voltage power of the light or sound coming through the source. Since the amplitude and energy have a ratio relationship, the more voltage, the more amplitude. 
<ul>

										<h3 class="major">2-Position PCB terminal </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>NO </p>
<p> What does the 2-Position PCB terminal do? 
<p> 
I did not end up using this for my design, as i ended up simply using the bread board instead of soldering the main part to the PCB board.

										<h3 class="major"> Hookup wire </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the Hookup wire do? 
<p> 

Helps connect the different pieces on the soldering board (only used for the light control)

										<h3 class="major">Split level shielded box </h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>
I didnâ€™t manage to find this piece, and found that it was unneeded so I simply stuck to using the breadboard, and soldering. 
 </p>
<p> What does the split level shielded box do? 
<p> 
I did not use this piece, but it works the same as a PCB terminal board, but it helps put all of the circuitry into a small contained space. </p>

										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the 8-Ohm 1" speaker do? 
<p> 

Helps produce the sound of the circuit, however I changed the speaker in the end so that it would create a louder sound and more vibrations.

										<h3 class="major">9-Volt battery snap</h3>
										<p> Did I manage to buy it? </p>
<p>Yes </p>
<p> What does the 9-Volt battery snap do? 
<p> 

Helps secure the battery to wires, in which you can solder to a board, or use in the breadboard.

								<h2>In addition</h2>
								<p>These were the materials I used that were in addition to the ones that were needed for the original theremin. This allowed me to better control my theremin, and produce steadier and louder tones.  </p>

									<section>
										<h3 class="major">Change-Larger speaker</h3>
										<p> Why did I change the speaker?  </p>
<p>
I changed to a larger speaker, so that there would be more vibrations. This helped produce a larger sound, and also helped with the cymatic production of the instrument.

									<section>
										<h3 class="major">Change-LED light schematic </h3>
										<p> What was this design?   </p>
<p>
In this design I managed to add more control to my theremin by adding a row of LED lights. By doing this I could have LED lights next to the photocells (which control allow the light to control the frequency produced) I then put the switches for these LED lights outside of the box so that I could control the LED lights, and control the sound produced. 
I also changed the design by adding the light that I could control, which involved more schematics, and LED lightbulbs. I also changed the design so that it was in the box instead, so that I could control almost all the light going to the theremin. 

</p>

									<section>
										<h3 class="major">Change-Aluminium foil</h3>
										<p> Why did I add aluminium foil? </p>
<p>

I added aluminium foil to help produce more reflection (in which it is not specular reflection but scattered) and this helped the light produce more intensity, because it was reflecting off the surface, instead of being absorbed.
